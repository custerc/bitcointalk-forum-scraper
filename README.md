# bitcointalk-forum-scraper
A quick scraper to grab post titles and dates from BitcoinTalk subforums. 

I got curious about what trends I might find in the non-Bitcoin-things Bitcoin people talk about, and I also wanted to practice scraping. I didn't find anything interesting at all, but I figured I'd share this anyway. It could save some time if you're looking into a similar question, and it should be pretty easy to modify to pull from different forums, etc.
